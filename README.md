# Automatic Data Cleaning
Research project about automatic data cleaning. 
The main goal is to develop a Python tool such that:
    Given a random raw dataset representing a machine learning problem, the Python tool is capable of automatically identifying the potential issues and reporting the results and recommendations to the end-user in an effective way.

Three aspects are meaningfully automated:
    Automatic Discovery of Data Types
    Automatic Missing Value Handling
    Automatic Outlier Detection
